HTTP authentication is on the server-side asking for some authentication information like username, password when
the client requests a URL. This is additional security for the request and the response being exchanged between the client and the server.

From the client-side these additional authentication information i.e. username and password can be sent in the headers,
which later on the server side will be validated. The response will be delivered from the server-side only when the authentication is valid.
If server asks client for authentication information, e.g. username and password, for providing response/data:
1. client sends authentication information in the request headers when requesting a URL
2. server validate the information, i.e. required data will delivered if authentication is valid
